I dont want

Butterflies in her stomach were replaced by fear
Life looks like a dark , miserable road without cheer 
She has this emptiness that can't be filled 
And there is desolation that veils the glinted field 
As she stands paralyzed and strengthless 
Victims of Sexual violence make senseless  
Still, She Gathers all her courage and says a prayer 
That justice will cure her inner dullness, despair

No one should be reduced to this painful state 
Everyone deserves their basic human right to be safe  
That can't be bought or sold and certainly not with pain
But strengthened within all hearts that come together and gain 
This is a fight against injustice, abuse and crime 
Let's work towards a world where every being feel sublime 



She is frightened deep inside
Sorrow and hopelessness  beside
Surrounded by unseen, threatening presence of them 
Which hardly grabs her soul in insecurity and blame 
Her smile fades away with her hopes,  dreams of future 
Now just depression, anxiety that's what she nurtures 
The curiosity she had as a child 
Is bothering massive cyclones which aren't mild
Our society accused her of bringing shame
By snatching away her hope and even name 
They treated her like an animal, not a girl 
Just to satisfy their barbaric thirst, no thinking which unfurls
The stigma surrounding sexual violence, won't let our heroine wear her crown 
She's not alone in this battle, many are enduring the same frown 
It demands a change from us all to stand up and put a shield against such crime 
And listen to stories of those affected with time. It's time for no more oppression worn as crown 
Time to lay down arms that ignite future destruction around.

The sorrow that doth plague her soul,
A pain that none but she doth know,
Her tears fall like summer rain,
A silent plea for love in vain.

What horrors must this made endure,
That she doth cry and wail so pure,
A heart so burdened with such strife,
That every night she takes her life.


Her spirit was crushed, her body weak,
No refuge left for her to seek,
A victim of a cruel design,
A prisoner of a world unkind. 

how the world hath failed this fair,
Injustice doth her life ensnare,
But yet she doth not yield to fate,
For hope still lingers, though it's late.

With every tear, she finds the strength,
To carry on, despite the length,
Of the path, she must tread alone,
Her courage is like a diamond stone.

And so she cries, with a heart so bold,
For all the tales that go untold,
For every soul that suffers so,
For every heart that longs to know.

May heaven's light guide her way,
And bring her solace every day,
For in her tears doth lie the power,
To conquer all, in life's darkest hour.

who Is to Blame?
 who is to blame in this darkening time, 
When so many have been subjected to crime? 
For whom are we turning a searching eye, 
As innocent girls must suffer and cry? 

Soft innocence used as weapon of fate, 
The faces of sweet lasses filled with hate. 
What fearful power doth hold up their hand, 
Deeming that these young victims must endure such pain? 

The blackest hearts can weaponize fear;  
Young girls' lives are thrown in disarray and queer.  
Our world's foundations swept out from beneath;  
Young girls stand broken in stagnant tears beneath. 

So now we must take up justice's call; 
Our souls must show that villains won't win at all!  
Know this - the fight for justice shall never wholly end:  
Nowhere else but here must good rise upon evil-bent!



When a girl wants to speak up for her rights 
She is  told to silence, put out of sight 
For looking outwards, fighting in vain 
They're seen as monsters and scorned again.
A lifetime of violence year after year 
All the while almost no one hears 
The cries and voices that plead for justice 
It's silenced instead with centuries of dust.

It's sad when rape is seen with shame, 
 As if the guilt lies in her name. 
To be devastated and violated this way - 
 So much to bear no words can say.

So many of us must rise to defend her right - 
To join forces as a mass uprising with might. 
We have a moral obligation to stand strong -  
And protect the victims of this horrible wrong.
It is terrible to get heard right now 
Feel she feels don't deserve to even breathe somehow 
She isn't sure whether she is alive or dead 
The marks and memories makes her sleeping like on death bed


the pain of a soul that's shattered,
Its pieces scattered, tattered and battered,
Feeling as though it's unworthy of breath,
Struggling to hold on, wishing for death.


The memories and marks of violence and hate,
Haunt her still, a burden too great,
Robbing her of peace, leaving her in fear,
Sleeping on a bed of death, so near.


No words can capture the depth of her pain,
The trauma, the shame, the loss, the disdain,
For what was done to her, without her consent,
A cruel act that no one should ever invent.


But though the darkness may seem endless,
There is hope, there is light, there is tenderness,
In the arms of those who love and support,
She can find strength, and a path to resort.

Let her know, that though it may seem dire,
She's not alone, and her pain is not entire,
For there are those who stand by her side,
Ready to help, ready to provide.

So let us pledge to stand against hate,
To speak out against violence, to not abate,
For in the fight for justice, we shall prevail,
And the broken shall rise, and their light shall never pale.
Let's stop blaming the victims for what they wear,
Or for being out late, or for being there,
For rape is not caused by the clothes they choose,
But by the rapist's desire to abuse.

Let's stop making excuses for the perpetrators,
And stop minimizing the impact on the survivors,
For rape is a violent violation of consent,
And the damage it does cannot be undone or spent.

Let's educate our young on healthy relationships,
On consent and boundaries, on respectful trips,
For when we teach respect and empathy,
We foster a culture of love and sympathy.

Let's hold the perpetrators accountable,
And let the survivors know they are valuable,
For in the pursuit of justice, we must not rest,
Until rape and sexual violence are put to the test.

For the conversation around rape must change,
To one of empathy, support, and range,
Where the survivors are uplifted and heard,
And the rapists are held accountable and deterred.

So let us reframe this conversation,
And work together for a better nation,
Where rape is seen as a grave disgrace,
And a culture of consent takes its rightful place.






In a house that once was a home,
Lived a girl who was all alone,
Her family, the ones who should protect,
Were the ones who caused her to deflect.

Their love was tainted with violence and hate,
Their hands, once gentle, now would berate,
Her body, her soul, her every being,
Leaving scars that no one was seeing.

Her mother, once kind and caring,
Now caused her daughter much despairing,
Her father, once strong and brave,
Now made her feel like a helpless slave.

The siblings, once her closest friends,
Now joined in the abuse and its deadly ends,
Their fists and words like daggers sharp,
Cutting deep, leaving a lasting mark.

And so she wrote, in her diary each night,
Of her pain, her fear, her will to fight,
And though her family had made her feel small,
She knew that someday, she would stand tall.

For the power of words, of love, of hope,
Is a force that can help one cope,
With the darkest of nights and the hardest of days,
And bring one closer to the light's warm rays.

So though this girl's story may be tragic,
Her spirit, her words, are truly magic,
And may they inspire us all to stand,
Against abuse and hate, hand in hand.






Innocent and pure, a child once bright,
Now a victim of a heinous plight,
Her father, brother, uncles, and kin,
Subjecting her to sin upon sin.

Where once love and safety did reside,
Now a darkness crept and did preside,
A soul defiled, a heartbroken,
By those who should have been a haven.

She wept and begged for mercy's grace,
But found no succour in this place,
For those who should have been her shield,
Had turned upon her with savage zeal.

Her spirit shattered, her trust destroyed,
Her life consumed by those who toyed,
With her innocence, her very being,
In acts that left her with no meaning.

 the cruelty of these beasts so vile,
Devoid of conscience, bereft of guile,
What madness could possess such men,
To inflict such pain on kin and kin.

We stand with her, a survivor brave,
                                 Whose strength and courage did not cave,
In the face of darkness and despair,
                                 her will to live did not impair.

May she find peace and healing now,
                                   May justice come with furrowed brow,
And may the scars that do remain,
                                    Be a testament to her strength regained.



In the darkness of the night,
Her tears fall like raindrops might,
Forced into a life of shame,
Sold for men to use, a never-ending game.

Her body is not hers to own,
As she is forced to be shown,
In videos for the pleasure of men,
Her soul screams out, never to be seen again.

In the darkness of the night,
Her tears fall like stars might,
Forced to sell her body and soul,
To satisfy the desires of men, she's lost control.
Her worth is measured in dollar bills,
Her body a product for men to thrill,
No longer human, but just an object,
Her humanity stripped away, it's now subject.

Her pain and suffering, invisible to most,
Hidden behind closed doors, it's easy to boast,
Of a world that's just, and treats all as equal,
But the reality is harsh, and its effects so lethal.

Her body is a prison, her mind a maze,
She's trapped in a world with no escape, no way to blaze,
A path to freedom, to break the chains,
Of a life that's filled with so much pain.

But hope still lingers, a flame in the dark,
A light that can guide her to a brand-new start,
To reclaim her worth, and her dignity,
To break free from this life of indignity

The life she leads is one of pain,
Her cries unheard, her heart in chains,
Her dreams of freedom now long gone,
Her spirit broken, her light now gone.

She was once a girl with hopes and dreams,
But now she's nothing, or so it seems,
Just a commodity, a product to sell,
A victim of a world that treats her like hell.

In the shadows, she hides her face,
Her eyes downcast, her heart displaced,
For all the hurt that she has known,
Has left her feeling so alone.

And yet, she fights to find a way,
To live another day,
To heal her wounds, to mend her soul,
To rise again, and be made whole.

For she knows that she is not alone,
That there are others who have known,
The pain and sorrow that she feels,
And have risen up, to break the seals.

To fight for justice, to make a stand,
To bring an end to this wicked land,
Where girls sold, and bought and used,
Their bodies broken, their spirits abused.

And though the road ahead is long,
And the journey hard, and sometimes wrong,
She knows that there is hope to be found,
In the hearts of those who are truly sound.

For in their eyes, she sees a light,
That shines so bright, and breaks the night,
And shows her that she is not alone,
That there is hope, and a way to be shown.

So let us stand, and fight for those,
Who are trapped in lives of woes,
And bring an end to this cruel fate,
And lift them up, to a better state.

In a world that's meant to be free,
Girls are trapped, they cannot flee,
From the horrors that surround them all,
Their voices silenced, their backs against the wall.

Forced into a life they did not choose,
Their bodies sold, for men to abuse,
Their dreams and hopes, now crushed and broken,
Their souls shattered, their spirits stolen.

They live in fear, and endless pain,
Their worth measured in what they can gain,
For the men who buy them, they're just a toy,
A source of pleasure, their feelings void.

Their bodies are not theirs to own,
They're used and abused, and then thrown,
Into a world of darkness and despair,
A life they never wanted, never thought was fair.

And yet, they fight to keep their flame alive,
To survive another day, and to strive,
To break free from the chains that bind,
To escape the darkness, and leave it behind.

Their spirits may be broken, but not their will,
They have the courage to rise, and to fulfill,
Their dreams of freedom, of a life they choose,
Where they're not just objects, but humans too.

So let us stand with them, and fight their fight,
To bring an end to this cruel plight,
To build a world where all can be free,
And girls can live a life of dignity.

The porn industry, a world of fantasy,
Where bodies are objectified, for all to see,
A place where pleasure is the only goal,
And the human spirit is left without a soul.

It's a world that preys on our desires,
Exploiting our needs, and fueling our fires,
With images that leave us wanting more,
And leave our souls empty, and our hearts sore.

It's a world that tells us that sex is just a game,
A game where all are players, and there's no shame,
But the reality is far from what we're shown,
For the porn industry is a world of its own.

It's a world where girls are used and abused,
Their bodies sold, and their spirits bruised,
For the pleasure of men who pay to see,
A life that's broken, and no longer free.

It's a world where consent is just a word,
And the dignity of girls is often blurred,
Where their worth is measured in how they look,
And their value is placed in a porn star's book.

It's a world that's built on exploitation,
A world that feeds on our fascination,
With the human form, and its many ways,
But it's a world that leaves us lost in a daze.

For we're sold a lie, that sex is just for fun,
But the reality is that our souls are done,
For the porn industry takes more than it gives,
Leaves us empty, and unable to live.

In the shadows, hidden away from the light,
Lies the dark world of porn, a harrowing sight,
Where girls are exploited and used for gain,
Their bodies violated, their souls in pain.

The industry's greed knows no bounds,
Forcing girls to perform, leaving them bound,
Used and abused, with no hope for escape,
Their dreams and aspirations, forever erased.

Raped and beaten, treated as mere objects,
Their pain and trauma, society neglects,
Chained and enslaved, their bodies for sale,
Their lives destroyed, their dignity pale.

Their cries for help fall on deaf ears,
As they're forced to face their darkest fears,
Trapped in a cycle of abuse and shame,
Their lives forever tarnished, a scarlet stain.

The porn industry's dark secrets, hidden from view,
Exploiting the weak and vulnerable, their hearts askew,
Their worth measured by their looks, and nothing more,
Their humanity stripped away, as they're pushed to the floor.

But we cannot stay silent, we must speak out,
Against the injustice that leaves so many in doubt,
We must fight for the girls, who are left in pain,
And create a world, where their dignity can reign.

For every girl who's trapped, and every girl who's hurt,
We must stand with them, and lift them from the dirt,
And build a world, where their worth is known,
And their dreams and aspirations, can forever be grown.

Let us break the chains, that hold them down,
And create a world, where their dignity will abound,
For every girl deserves a life that's free,
From the bondage of abuse, and from the porn industry

Dowry, the curse on society,
A barbaric practice that must cease to be.
A system built on greed and pride,
Where girls are sold like goods to buy.

It starts with the birth of a girl,
Parents dread the thought of the dowry they'll swirl.
A life of struggle, of saving every dime,
Just to marry off their daughter in time.

But even then, it's not enough,
The demands keep rising, the pressure is rough.
Gold, cash, cars, and property,
All for a marriage that's meant to be.

And then the groom's family enters the scene,
With their list of demands, so obscene.
The girl's family must comply,
Or risk bringing shame to their name.

The girl's dreams and aspirations are shattered,
Her life no longer her own, but what the groom's family mattered.
She's a prisoner, a slave to their whims,
Her worth measured in material things.

And if she fails to meet their demands,
She's abused, tortured, and sometimes banned.
Her fate left to the mercy of fate,
Her life in tatters, her soul full of hate.

We must break the shackles of this curse,
And ensure that every girl can live without fear.
It's time for us to take a stand,
And put an end to this practice, oh so grand.

Let's empower our girls to chase their dreams,
To be fearless and confident, to achieve the impossible it seems.
Let's break down the walls of this system so wrong,
And give every girl a chance to be strong.

For it's time to rewrite the story,
Of girls who are sold, and lives so sorry.
Let's pledge to make a difference,
And free every girl from this vicious sentence


In a world where love and marriage should be pure,
The practice of dowry remains a stubborn lure.
A bride-to-be, caught up in the dowry game,
Is but a mere pawn in an unfair claim.

A father's love for his daughter, pure and true,
Should not be measured by the gifts he can accrue.
For dowry, the price tag of a bride,
Is but a cage in which her spirit will hide.

Her worth is not measured in material things,
But rather in the joy and love she brings.
Her heart's desires, her passions and dreams,
Should be the focus of the suitor's schemes.

Yet still we see the dowry system thrive,
A stain on the fabric of modern life.
The value of a woman, cheapened by this trend,
Her life's path narrowed, her choices penned.

Forced to marry someone who'll pay the price,
Her heart's desire dismissed, a sacrifice.
Her life now at the mercy of a stranger's whim,
Her spirit crushed, her future dim.

A father who cannot afford the fee,
Will surely face societal scrutiny.
A daughter who cannot find a match,
Will face ridicule and often dispatch.

Oh, dowry, a cruel and callous game,
Bringing only misery, sorrow and shame.
A tradition that has no place in modern times,
A scourge that should be purged from all minds.

Let us all take a stand against this vice,
And raise our voices against this injustice twice.
Let us declare our love without any price,
And break the chains of this system so unwise.

For a girl should be cherished, loved and free,
To pursue her passions and her destiny.
Let us create a world where she can thrive,
A world where her worth is never based on a bribe.

So let us pledge to support our sisters dear,
And break the shackles that they live in fear.
Let us fight against this practice so severe,
And end this dowry system once and for all, my dear.








In the game of dowry, it's not just the bride who's caught,
But the groom too, unknowingly, he becomes a part of the plot.
A cycle of greed and coercion that repeats over time,
It's a tradition that's deeply ingrained, a cultural crime.

Father forgets that once he too had taken dowry,
And now he's forcing his daughter to bear the same story.
The groom too, blinded by his own ego and pride,
Doesn't realize that he too is on the wrong side.

But the bride, the victim of this cruel game,
Her life is ruined, her dreams go up in flames.
She's bought and sold, her worth measured in gold,
Her happiness and well-being, forever put on hold.

It's time to break this cycle of abuse and greed,
To give the bride the respect and love she needs.
A union of two hearts, based on love and trust,
Without any price tag, without any lust.
For a dowry-free society, we must fight,
And embrace a new dawn, where love is the only light.

Innocent eyes, so pure and bright,
A precious life that shone so bright,
But the world was cruel and full of plight,
And darkness fell upon her like a blight.

The men around her, so depraved,
An innocent life, they so enslaved,
Their lustful hands, so cruelly waved,
And shattered her soul, as she lay there un-saved.

From father to brother, uncle and friend,
Their evil ways, they did not end,
Aunts and uncles, they did offend,
And the horror continued, with no defend.

They took from her, what was not theirs,
Innocent flesh, they treated like wares,
No one to hear her, no one to care,
A life destroyed, in the hands of the snares.

And though she tried, with all her might,
To fight against the endless night,
The darkness won, and snuffed her light,
Leaving the world, in utter fright.

This is the fate, of too many girls,
Their lives destroyed, by society's whirls,
We must stand up, against these wrongs unfurls,
And protect their lives, with all our pearls.

Her heart, once pure and trusting,
Was broken by a love so unjustly.
Her secrets now revealed, her fear growing,
Her studies halted, her dreams lost.

Her heart shattered as her love betrayed,
Her moments, once private, now displayed.
Her studies stopped, fear consumed her soul,
And her pain left her feeling far from whole.




Innocent and young, with love in her heart,
She trusted him, never to be torn apart.
But he betrayed her, oh how he shattered her soul,
By making her private moments public, no longer whole.

Fear consumed her, her studies came to a halt,
As she struggled to regain what she once sought.
A relative offered a chance to study and grow,
But little did she know, it was a trap, a toxic show.

Her own kin, the ones she trusted, blackmailed her so,
Threatening to hurt her sister, it was a cruel blow.
Against her will, they raped her, destroying her trust,
It seemed like a never-ending cycle of unjust.

She thought work would bring an escape, a new start,
But again, she was met with cruelty, tearing her apart.
Her boss saw her as inferior, just a tool to use,
Raped in the elevator, to move forward, she had to lose.

Called to the cabin, told to submit to him,
Her body a commodity, it all seemed so grim.
A life that once had dreams and aspirations,
Now consumed by pain, violence, and frustrations.

Oh, the plight of the girl, in a society so unjust,
Where she's merely an object, to be used and thrust.
Betrayed by love, by family, by work, by all she knew,
Her spirit may be broken, but her courage will renew.

Let us raise our voice, for the girl's rights to be heard,
To stop the cycle of violence, so she can soar like a bird.
May her struggles never be in vain, may her voice be strong,
For we will fight beside her, till justice is served, till the wrong is gone.








































This is a tale that's all too real,
A story that transcends time and place,
Of pain and trauma that girls feel,
A danger lurking in every space.

It happens in homes and in classes,
With children and in neighborhoods,
A vicious cycle that surpasses
Any attempts to change its moods.

Ask the girls in your own abode,
And you'll find that this story's true,
The same tale that's oft been told,
Of what they've been subjected to.

The danger lurks in every corner,
A danger that's omnipresent,
A peril that's hard to conquer,
An enemy that's quite incessant.



But the girl's life is forever changed
Her innocence is now rearranged
She is haunted by the trauma she faced
And by the memories that can't be erased

She wonders if she'll ever feel whole again
Or if this pain will always remain
She wants justice, but it seems so far
In a world that doesn't value who they are

This is not just a story, it's a tragedy
A reality that should fill us with agony
We need to stand up and speak out
To make sure this is not what life is about
In this world, men hold the power,
And women are preyed upon each hour,
It's a scary and sad reality,
One that we must address with clarity.

My friend's message struck me to the core,
If only death was a better score,
For girls who live in constant fear,
Of being violated, with no one near.

I couldn't respond, what could I say?
When girls are assaulted every single day,
From the crowded metros to the empty alleys,
Their safety is compromised, their dignity in valleys.

Even when I accidentally collide,
With a girl who scolds, her anger I can't abide,
I know it's not my fault, but I still feel the shame,
For I know the culprit is a man who has no game.

A man who gropes, a man who leers,
A man who masturbates and feeds on fears,
This man is everywhere, and I am he,
A part of a society that lets him be.

He puts his hands on shoulders and waists,
He caresses backs and leaves girls disgraced,
He rubs his penis on buses, on hostel walls,
His actions leave scars, and society mauls.

He gives chocolates and shows off his status,
But when he's done, the girl's life is in hiatus,
Her dreams and aspirations shattered,
Her life forever altered and tattered.

I am ashamed, for these forms are mine,
And I know that I must draw the line,
I must be the change that the world needs,
And ensure that women's rights and safety precedes.

The suffocating girls in this society
Their plight is one that none can deny
Victims of a system that's rigged against them
Their fate determined by the whims of men

It starts with a feeling of power and control
A desire to dominate, to own, to hold
In the bed, it's not about pleasure or love
But the rush of power, the animal inside us, we shove

We're not having sex, we're showcasing our might
To prove to the world we're the kings of the night
Our girlfriends know how rough we can be
In the name of power, we rob them of their dignity

This power is not confined to the bedroom walls
It flows into the streets, into public stalls
Where men grope, touch, and harass with impunity
Their power unchecked, fueled by their masculinity

The power dynamics are clear to see
Men hold the reins, and women are at their mercy
A subtle touch, a grab, a groping hand
A constant reminder that women are not in command

The system is rigged, and the girls suffer
Every day, every moment, it's getting tougher
To exist, to survive, to thrive in a world
Where men hold all the power, and girls are left to unfurl




The power of masculinity, a force to behold
A feeling that's nurtured, from young and old
It's the feeling of control, of dominance and might
A feeling so strong, it clouds our sight

In bed, we show it off, our girlfriends know
We don't make love, we put on a show
We display our power, with every thrust
In that moment, we feel like we must

Our power cannot be contained, it spills out
Into the world, it seeks to shout
We massage arms in crowds, we slap hips
We grope breasts, it's all in our grips

We transfer our power, a subtle ritual
One that's been passed down, from time immemorial
When it cannot be contained, it seeks to reign
Over the world, it seeks to maintain

It's a poverty, a sickness that afflicts us men
We want to dominate, again and again
We deny the existence of suffocating girls
We don't care about their cries or their whorls

Our power blinds us, we can't see the truth
The harm we cause, the damage we ruth
We don't care about their pain, their fears
We revel in our power, in our leers

We must stop and listen, to their voices
We must understand, their choices
We must empathize, with their plight
We must fight for their rights, with all our might

The power of masculinity, it's time to rethink
It's time to let go, of this poisonous ink
It's time to embrace, a new way of being
One that's based on love, and true seeing

We must understand, that power is not a game
It's not something to use, to control or maim
It's something to share, to lift up and empower
It's something to use, to build and empower




In this world where masculinity is power
We dominate, we conquer, we tower
Our ego so fragile, our mind so weak
We seek validation from every girl we seek

Our inner poverty is like a disease
It dominates our actions with such ease
We think we love, but do we really?
Or are we just satisfying our own needs, really?

Our girlfriends and wives, they suffer in silence
Our domination over them, it's violence
We don't understand the situation at hand
We think consent is enough to make a stand

But have we ever asked ourselves, have we tried?
To understand the pain we cause, the tears we've dried
The girl who joined us, did she really think
That love is what we did, with consent, like a wink?

Our mindset is our biggest mistake
We can't see beyond our own ego's sake
Why wouldn't we be mad at seeing someone outside?
When we can't even understand the pain we provide

Our poverty is a curse, a plague upon us
It makes us blind, it makes us unjust
We don't see the suffocating girls in our society
We just want to dominate, in every stage and variety

But let me tell you, my fellow men
There is a way out, a way to end
This poverty that we carry deep inside
It starts with empathy, with opening our eyes wide

We must listen, we must understand
The pain that we cause, with our own hand
We must stop dominating, stop using our power
And start loving, start caring, every minute, every hour

For only then, can we truly be
The men that we aspire to see
The ones who respect, the ones who care
The ones who end this poverty, this despair.










As I ponder on this matter,
The weight of guilt and shame
Crushes down upon my heart
For I know I share the blame.

For every time I stayed silent
When my friends spoke in crude ways
I gave them power to objectify
And prey on girls as if they're prey.

And for every time I dismissed
The cries and pleas of a victim
I contributed to a culture
That treats women as less human.

It's time to admit our faults
And take responsibility too
For the crimes and injustices
That women suffer, it's not new.

We need to raise our children right
Teach them that gender is not a divide
That every person deserves respect
And dignity, it's not something to be denied.

Let's not make girls' beauty
A means of measuring their worth
For they are more than just their looks
And their value extends far beyond the earth.

And in our workplaces and schools
Let's call out bad behavior
And make it known that such actions
Will not be tolerated, nor ever.

For it's the little things we do
That can have the biggest impact
In changing the toxic culture
And paving the way for a better contract.



In the heat of passion, we forget
The weight of our actions, the toll they'll exact
On those we claim to love, to cherish, to protect
Our desire becomes an all-consuming threat

We seek to dominate, to assert our power
To prove our manliness in that fleeting hour
We forget the purity of the moment
As we rush to leave our mark, to make it potent

But what about her, the one we claim to care for?
What about her feelings, her desires, her core?
Do we stop to ask, to listen, to understand?
Or do we plow ahead with our own demands?

We forget that love is more than just physical
It's emotional, mental, spiritual
It's a bond that goes beyond the skin
A connection that goes deep within

We forget that our actions have consequences
That our selfishness has repercussions
That the trauma we inflict is not just physical
But emotional, mental, and spiritual

We forget that love is a partnership
That it requires communication and consent
That forcing someone to do something against their will
Is not love, but a violation of their dignity and free will

It's time to wake up, to see the truth
That our actions have a ripple effect, a proof
That we are not just hurting our partners
But also perpetuating a culture that's darker

We need to educate ourselves and our children
On gender equality, respect, and consent
On the beauty and worth of every human being
Regardless of their gender or anything

We need to stand up and speak out
Against stalking, harassment, and assault
To be allies, not bystanders
To break the silence, to be the difference-makers

It's time to redefine what it means to be a man
To reject the toxic masculinity that's a sham
To embrace a new definition of strength and power
One that's based on respect, love, and honor

So let's start with ourselves, with our own actions
Let's make a change, let's have a reaction
Let's love our partners in their fullness
Without reducing them to objects of our lust and roughness.




In this world of chaos and pain,
Where oppression seems to reign,
We must look within ourselves,
And change the way we think and feel.

For too long we've let our desires,
Lead us to commit heinous crimes,
Against those who are weaker,
And those who cannot fight.

But now it's time to take a stand,
To change our ways, to understand,
That love is what we truly need,
Not violence or dominance or greed.

We must learn to control our urges,
And see the value of consent,
For it's not about what we want,
But about mutual respect.

Let's show love to our wives and partners,
Not try to force them to our will,
For the power of love is greater,
Than any momentary thrill.

And as we make these changes within,
We'll send a better energy to the world,
A light of hope that shines so bright,
For every boy and every girl.

So let's replace oppression with love,
And send a message to the world,
That we can be better, we can change,
And create a better world for all.

























                    Against prostitution 

In a dark and desolate world,
A girl's innocence was sold and hurled,
Into a life of misery and pain,
A life where she has no control or gain.

She was forced to sell her body,
To satisfy the whims of those who were gaudy,
Her tears went unnoticed and unheard,
Her voice was silenced and blurred.

Forced into a life of shame,  
Her body used for others' gain.  
A victim of society's neglect,  
Her future now an uncertain prospect. 

Her eyes once held a spark of hope,  
Now empty and devoid of scope.  
Her spirit broken, her will now weak,  
She carries on, day by day, week by week. 

No one hears her silent cries,  
No one sees the pain in her eyes.  
Lost in a world of darkness and despair,  
She longs for someone to care. 




But no one comes to her aid,  
As she continues to be betrayed.  
Sold and used like a commodity,  
Her life now a tragic anomaly. 

She was treated like a mere object,
Used and abused without any respect,
Her dreams shattered, her hopes dimmed,
Her body violated, her soul trimmed.

Her life was no longer her own,
A victim of the vicious and the unknown,
Her screams echoed in the night,
As she fought against this vile plight.

But her cries fell on deaf ears,
And her pain remained unseen and unclear,
For in a world where lust rules all,
A girl's worth is measured by how much she can enthrall.

So let us not turn a blind eye,
To the pain of those who are forced to comply,
Let us rise up and fight against this plight,
And give these girls the chance to see the light.

For they deserve to be loved and cherished,
Not bought and sold like some perishable merchandise,
Let us stand with them and be their voice,
And help them break free from this cruel choice.

For every girl forced into prostitution,  
We must show love and compassion.  
We must lift them up and offer a way,  
To a future full of hope and light of day.



In the depths of our souls, we find a truth,
A truth that transcends our daily pursuit,
A truth that speaks of love and unity,
Of empathy, compassion, and community.

But in this world, so full of noise and distraction,
We often forget this essential satisfaction,
We chase after power, wealth, and fame,
Ignoring the cost, neglecting the pain.

We live in a society that values success,
But success at what cost? What do we address?
Do we measure our worth by the money we earn,
Or by the kindness we show, the lessons we learn?

It's time for us to awaken, to open our eyes,
To see the world through a new set of ties,
To embrace our humanity, our shared existence,
And recognize that we all need assistance.

For in the end, it's not about what we gain,
But about how we live, how we manage the strain,
And if we can find it within ourselves to be kind,
Then a better world we'll surely find.





In this world, so vast and wide
There are those who can't hide
From the eyes that follow their every move
And the hands that invade their groove

These girls, so innocent and pure
Are subject to a world so obscure
Where stalkers lurk in every corner
And their peace of mind they must barter



In a world where power reigns supreme,
The innocent are prey to a sinister scheme.
Girls, vulnerable and pure of heart,
Are subject to society's oppressive art.

Stalkers lurk in every corner,
Their lecherous gaze like a foreigner,
Invading the privacy of a girl's mind,
Leaving behind scars, hard to unwind.






In a society that glorifies masculinity,
Girls are made to feel like a liability.
Their intelligence, their achievements, all ignored,
Their worth measured by their beauty, adored.

They are told to dress modestly, stay inside,
And yet, they are blamed if they are assaulted, defied.
Their freedom curtailed, their choices denied,
Their lives controlled, their hopes denied.

It's time for us to wake up and see,
That a girl's life deserves to be free.
Let's build a world where girls can thrive,
Where their dreams are realized, and they can come alive.


Innocent hearts, pure and young,
Their fate decided before they've sprung,
Forced into unions they don't desire,
Their dreams and hopes now set on fire.

In the depths of the human soul,
Lies a darkness we cannot control,
A force that seeks to dominate,
And dictate the fates of those we hate.

To be married against one's will,
Is a fate too cruel to instill,
A life of misery and despair,
A life that no one should have to bear.



Society's expectations, traditions to uphold,
But at what cost, their hearts sold?
Chains of oppression, they're made to wear,
Their freedom and choice, stripped bare.

Parents, guardians, don't you see,
The damage that you're causing, can't you set them free?
Marriage should be a bond of love and trust,
Not a means to satisfy society's unjust.

Let their hearts and minds be free,
Let them choose their own destiny,
Forced marriages, a tragedy in disguise,
Let's break these chains, and let them rise.

Let them bloom and grow with love,
Let their hearts soar and reach above,
For in their happiness lies our own,
Let's break these chains, and let love be known.

















Forced into marriages, they have no say
Their lives become a game, a mere play
Their future determined by the hands of another
Their fate sealed, as if under a spell or a curse

To some, it may seem a cultural norm
But for these girls, it's a life so forlorn
Their dreams and aspirations forever lost
As they become a possession, at a great cost

No longer able to live life on their own terms
Their desires, their passions, all go unconfirmed
Their voices silenced, their spirits broken
Their hearts heavy, and their eyes a token

Of the pain that they carry deep inside
As they continue to live in this forced ride
Their emotions run high, but they cannot be expressed
Their thoughts and opinions, forever repressed

Forced into a world, they didn't choose to belong
Their future dictated, as if they don't belong
Their lives reduced to mere commodities
To be traded, bought, and sold like properties

Their bodies are a gift, but not theirs to give
Their choices, their rights, taken away like a sieve
Their worth, their value, reduced to a price
Their dignity and self-worth, taken without a fight

It's time for a change, for a world so new
Where girls are respected, and their dreams come true
Where they can decide, their own fate and destiny
Where their voice is heard, and they can truly be free

Let's break this cycle, this age-old tradition
And let girls live a life with ambition
Where they can thrive, and not just survive
And be the best versions of themselves, so alive.

Let's empower them with knowledge and skill
So that they can achieve what they truly will
Let's support them, and give them a chance
To shine bright and make their own stance



Forced marriages, a thing of the past
Let's make a change, that will forever last
Let's give these girls the gift of life
And let them be the ones to decide.



Abhinav, a philosopher and thinker,
In India, he dwelled, seeking to uncover
The truth behind the trials of women,
And the injustices they face, one after another.

He saw the pain of dowry, a burden to bear,
A price to be paid for a daughter to wed,
A cycle of debt, oppression, and despair,
That kept women under society's tread.

But even beyond this, a more heinous crime,
Forced marriage, a horror that he could not condone,
Girls robbed of their youth, of their freedom and time,
Their futures sealed, before they have even grown.

Abhinav saw the shackles of tradition,
The weight of customs and ancient norms,
That kept women in a state of submission,
Their dreams and desires considered the lesser forms.

He saw the fear in their eyes, the pain in their hearts,
The hopelessness that engulfed them like a shroud,
As they were stripped of their agency, their essential parts,
Treated like property, disallowed to be proud.

But Abhinav did not simply observe and despair,
He spoke out against the oppression of girls and women,
He called for change, for a world that is fair,
Where every person's worth is considered a given.

Abhinav, with a heavy heart,
Sees the suffering of these girls, torn apart,
And so, he speaks out against this cruel fate,
Demanding change, before it's too late.


He called for education, for opportunities,
For girls to be treated as equals and more,
To be allowed to thrive and fulfill their destinies,
To be valued for their minds, their talents, their core.

And though the road is long, the journey fraught with strife,
Abhinav remained committed to the cause,
He would not give up, not while there was still life,
For he knew that true change would only come from his pause.




So let us all take up this banner, this call to arms,
To fight for the rights of girls and women, to make their voices heard,
For the time is now, to end all these harms,
And create a world where every person is valued, cherished, and revered.



In a world of ancient customs and traditions,
There exists a practice that defies all reason,
A bond that's formed without consent or volition,
A forced marriage, a union without passion.

Girls are often the ones who bear the brunt,
Of this archaic custom, this barbaric stunt,
Forced into a life they never chose,
Their dreams and aspirations forever froze.

Their fate is decided without their say,
Their hearts and minds forced to obey,
Their lives forever altered and changed,
In a world where their voices are estranged.

The love they seek is deemed unnecessary,
Their desires and wishes viewed as secondary,
Their worth measured in their domesticity,
Their dreams of education and freedom, mere frivolity.

Forced into a marriage they never wanted,
Their souls and spirits forever haunted,
By the injustice of their stolen fate,
By the loss of their autonomy, the cost of their state.

Their identities stripped, their agency taken,
Their potential squandered, their will forsaken,
Trapped in a life they never chose,
Their souls forever scarred, their hearts never close.

Forced marriages of girls, a practice so archaic,
A societal ill, a custom so tragic,
A violation of human rights, a crime against humanity,
A blight on our world, a stain on our dignity.

Forced marriages of girls, a tragedy so real,
Let us work together, let us heal,
A world that's broken, a world that needs repair,
Let us build a world, where every girl is free and fair.




Oh, the weight of her burden, so heavy to bear,
The scars and the pain, the constant despair,
The feeling of worthlessness, the struggle to survive,
The fear that engulfs her, the wish to not be alive.

Her heart aches with every breath that she takes,
As the memories flood in, and the pain awakes,
The bruises and the cuts, the wounds that won't heal,
The trauma that lingers, the torment she feels.

She wonders if she'll ever be free from this pain,
If she'll ever be able to break from this chain,
If there'll ever be a day when she can smile,
When she can breathe with ease, and rest for a while.

But hope seems so far away, like a distant dream,
As she struggles to escape, from this endless stream,
Of violence and abuse, of horror and pain,
Of a life that she didn't choose, but was forced to sustain.

Yet, in the depths of her despair, a flicker of light,
A glimmer of hope, that shines so bright,
A strength that rises, a spirit that soars,
A will to survive, that refuses to be torn.

For she knows deep down, that she is not alone,
That there are others who stand with her, who have shown,
That there is a way out, that there is a path,
To a life that's worth living, to a future that's bright.

So she takes a deep breath, and finds the strength within,
To rise up and fight, to break from this sin,
To reclaim her life, to find her way,
To a world that's safe, where she can stay.

For she knows that she deserves to live,
To be happy, to be free, to receive,
Love and kindness, and a life that's true,
To be herself, and not just make it through.

And so she takes another step, and another,
Towards a life that's full, and a future that's brighter,
Towards a world where no one will have to feel,
Like they don't deserve to breathe, or to heal.




















Why blame the girls for what they bear,
For crimes against them, so unfair?
Why shift the blame to those in pain,
And punish them again and again?
Why force them to hide and stay,
When justice should pave the way?

Why victim-blame when we should see,
The root of the problem in society?
Why ask what she was wearing or doing,
When the real issue is power and thinking?
Why make her feel guilty and shamed,
When the perpetrator should be blamed?

Why do we teach our daughters to fear,
Instead of teaching our sons to hear,
Their no's, their boundaries, their rights,
And respect them without any fights?
Why do we make the victim suffer,
When it's the rapist who deserves the buffer?

Why blame the girls for what they bear,
When they're the ones who are truly rare,
Strong and brave to face the world,
Despite the stigma and insults hurled?
Let's change our perspective and start,
To support and uplift every broken hear
































In love's embrace, a higher force,
That binds two souls in its pure course,
With every breath, with every kiss,
A union formed, in timeless bliss.

But when the force is one of power,
And love is stripped of its sweet flower,
What's left is but a hollow shell,
Of agony and endless hell.

To force oneself on one's own spouse,
Is to rob them of their very house,
Of dignity and self-respect,
And leave them feeling so abject.

For love is not just physical,
It's spiritual and magical,
And when we seek to dominate,
We seal our own unhappy fate.

Let's cherish those we love and hold,
With tenderness and hearts so bold,
For in that love, we find our peace,
And all our doubts and fears release.







For only then can we truly see,
The beauty of love's majesty.




Love, a word so pure and divine
Yet humans distort it, commit a crime
Forcing themselves on their beloved spouse
To fulfill desires, they cannot arouse

Lust and pleasure, they seek to gain
Ignoring their partner's hurt and pain
Forgetting the bond they once shared
Leaving their love and respect impaired

Innocence is stolen, hearts left scarred
As selfish actions leave their love marred
Trauma inflicted, wounds deep and raw
Mental state shattered, a painful flaw

Consequences of such actions severe
Ruining lives, breeding hate and fear
It's time to understand love's true meaning
To cherish it, and end this darkening screening

Let's embrace love in its purest form
Respect, care and trust, a new norm
Let's put an end to forced desires
And reignite the passion of love's fires.



It's easy to be swayed by desires so strong,
To demand your own pleasure, ignore what's wrong.
But remember, your wife is not just for sex,
She's a partner in life, who needs love and respect.

If you force her to do what she doesn't want,
You'll inflict wounds on her spirit that will always haunt.
She'll be filled with anger, sorrow and pain,
And never be able to trust you again.

So it's better to start loving her, body and soul,
And appreciate the moments that make you whole.
For love is not just about physical pleasure,
It's about deep connections that you'll always treasure.

If you cherish her and make her feel secure,
She'll open up to you and love you even more.
Her heart will be filled with warmth and affection,
And she'll find solace in your loving attention.

But if you abuse her, she'll feel trapped and alone,
A victim of your selfishness, powerless and unknown.
The trauma you cause will never fade away,
And haunt her for the rest of her days.

So choose your path wisely, and treat her with care,
For love and respect are what your wife deserves to share.
Remember, her heart is fragile, and needs your embrace,
So cherish her always, and let love fill every space.
The call for gender equality,
A noble cause we must uphold with sincerity
For too long women have faced the brunt
Of societal norms and cultural stunt


Their beauty deemed attainable or unattainable
Reduced to objects, often found vulnerable
But who will show compassion to their plight
When their attackers are filled with spite

It starts with teaching our children well
About gender equality, a message we must tell
No difference between sister and friend
For the plant has different flowers, yet they blend

At work, we must stop our friends
From behaving like stalkers, for it offends
A behavior that can lead to dire consequences
Or teach others to follow, and repeat offenses

Looking at girls is one thing,
But staring and doing X-rays, an alarming fling
We must acknowledge the difference
And ensure that it never crosses the fence

Forcing a woman to have sex against her will
Inflicts trauma and leaves a mental chill
Rather, let love and compassion reign
For such moments hold their own significance, don't constrain

Let's shun the momentary pleasure
That leaves behind an emotional treasure
And understand the importance of love
That brings joy, peace, and happiness thereof

The consequences of ignoring their plight
Are terrible, a black mark on humanity's sight
Let's show empathy, love, and respect
For women, who deserve nothing but the best.




She is not the representation of feminine grace
Whose cruel acts leave innocence in disgrace
No sympathy we offer for her ill-willed deeds
As we stand with the purity that victim bleeds

Girls are not merely a word, a symbol to uphold
Their innocence is sacred, we must staunchly uphold
Where they are oppressed, we must rise to support
Where they are exploited, we must strive to thwart

Those who aid in exploitation, they do not belong
For feminine nature sings a different song
Of compassion, kindness, and empathy in kind
And to those who violate it, we leave them behind

We stand with the innocent, the pure and the true
Their stories we hear, their cries we heed, we pursue
And those who dare to cause them harm or pain
We teach them a lesson, for they must not reign

The feminine soul is a light to behold
And those who tarnish it, leave their own stories untold
For in the end, only kindness and love remain
And those who embody it, shall forever reign.




The power that we hold within,
As men, is not a thing of sin.
But when we use it to dominate,
And exploit girls, it's a cruel fate.

Our masculinity should not define,
The way we treat the feminine divine.
Sex should not be a power game,
But a moment of love, without shame.

But many men seek to assert,
Their power, making girls hurt.
They rush to see their animal side,
And ignore the purity of the moment's tide.

We use sex to show our might,
To strike a girl's vagina with our sight.
Our girlfriends know how rude we are,
In bed, we treat them like a cheap cigar.

This power transfer, when unfulfilled,
Is released in ways that should be killed.
We massage arms, slap hips and grope,
Asserting power, losing hope.

This poverty of the mind,
Is a common disease we find.
Some control it, some don't,
All want to dominate and flaunt.

Our inner poverty dominates,
Our girlfriends and wives, we deprecate.
Do we love them in those moments,
Or just use them to satisfy our elements?

Do girls think that rape is love,
When they join us, like a dove?
Have we tried to understand,
Their consent, and the power in our hands?

Our mindset needs to be questioned,
Our actions, our thoughts, our intention.
We make mistakes, we must admit,
And learn from them, to benefit.

Love should not be a power game,
But a connection that we can claim.
We must respect girls, their innocence,
And teach the cruel ones, a lesson intense.

For the word, "girl" does not define,
Their actions, their nature, their design.
We must stand with innocence,
And not those who cause turbulence








Compassion for those who abuse,
Is hard to find, impossible to choose,
Their victims, vulnerable and weak,
Are left with scars, both physical and bleak.

How can we claim to love and care,
When we inflict pain, and cause despair?
Our wives and girlfriends, whom we hold dear,
Deserve our love, and nothing to fear.


Don't put beauty in a category,
Unattainable, or too extraordinary,
Girls deserve respect, not just lust,
Treat them with kindness, not disgust.

In the workplace, stop stalking friends,
Their actions could have deadly ends,
Rapists are born, not made in a day,
Teach them now, or they'll surely pay.

Looking is fine, but don't cross the line,
Staring, gawking, is not fine,
Respect boundaries, and their privacy,
Don't reduce them to mere commodity.

Gender equality is a cause worth fighting,
To end the oppression, and stop the biting,
Of those who abuse their power,
And make girls' lives a living shower.

Let us stand with the innocent,
And bring to justice the malevolent,
Teach the cruel, and show them the way,
For a better tomorrow, a brighter day.











Kindness is a virtue that can heal,
A touch of compassion that we can feel,
It’s the balm that soothes our pain,
The ray of hope amidst the rain.

A kind word or gesture goes a long way,
It can brighten up someone's day,
It costs nothing to be kind,
But the impact it has is one of a kind.

In a world full of chaos and strife,
Kindness is the thread that binds us to life,
It’s the beacon of light that shows us the way,
The guiding force that leads us astray.

It’s easy to be caught up in our own needs,
But kindness is about fulfilling others' deeds,
It’s about lending a hand to those in need,
To help them overcome the impossible deed.

It’s the act of giving without any expectation,
Of spreading joy and love in every nation,
It’s the language that all can understand,
The thread that unites every land.

Kindness is the antidote to hate,
The medicine that cures all our fate,
It’s the force that can conquer all,
The power that can make us stand tall.



So let’s be kind in all that we do,
And spread this message to others too,
For a little kindness can go a long way,
And brighten up someone's darkest day.






















The world is vast and full of wonder,
But sometimes, we're left to ponder,
What is our place in this great expanse?
What is the meaning of our life's dance?

We search for answers, high and low,
In books, in people, in places we go,
We seek the wisdom of the sages,
And look for clues in ancient pages.

But what if the answers we seek,
Are not found in words we speak?
What if the truth lies in our hearts,
In the compassion that each of us imparts?

Kindness is the key, this we know,
It's what makes our world a better show,
It's what binds us, heart to heart,
And makes us stronger, right from the start.

Kindness is not a simple act,
It's a way of life, that we must enact,
It's not just about being nice,
It's about being good, being wise.


We must be kind to ourselves first,
For it's from within that kindness bursts,
We must nurture our own self-care,
And show ourselves the love we all deserve to bear.

But kindness must not stop with us,
We must spread it far and wide, without fuss,
We must be kind to those we meet,
To strangers on the street, and even those we greet.

Kindness is a powerful force,
It can change the world, without remorse,
It can heal the hurt, and soothe the pain, 
And bring sunshine, after the rain.



















She was pure, a delicate flower,
Until they came, with such power.
Ripped her soul, and left her bare,
In a world, that didn't seem to care.

They took her innocence, with their lust,
And left her feeling, nothing but disgust.
Her screams were silenced, by their force,
As they showed her, what was their true source.

But after, when the damage was done,
She was seen, as nothing but a used one.
Blamed and shamed, for their own crime,
Her life was shattered, in no time.

They said she asked for it, with her dress,
As if that gave them the right, to express,
Their animalistic nature, without a care,
Leaving her to suffer, in despair.

But she was more than just a body,
More than an object, for their hobby.
She was a person, with dreams and goals,
A being, with a beautiful soul.

Her voice deserves to be heard,
Her pain should not be ignored.
She deserves justice, and so much more,
For the violence, that she had to endure.

It's time to change the narrative,
To stop blaming and shaming the captive.
To hold accountable, those who inflict,
And to give the survivors, the love and respect.

Let's educate, and spread awareness,
Of the horrors, that they face with fairness.
Let's stand together, as a united force,
To give the survivors, a path to recourse.

Because girls are not just used objects,
They are not just there for men's subjects.
They are human beings, with worth and value,
And it's time we acknowledge, and pursue.

Justice for the survivors, and a world of change,
Where they are seen, as more than just strange.
Where they are celebrated, for their strength,
And their resilience, goes to great lengths.




So let's stand up, and speak out,
Against this crime, that fills us with doubt.
Let's be a voice, for the ones in pain,
And let's never forget, that they are not to blame.




They say she asked for it,
Because of what she wore,
Her body was on display,
So she must have wanted more.

But did they ask her for her consent,
Or even look into her eyes?
Did they ask her how she feels,
Or hear her silent cries?

No, they took what they wanted,
And left her broken and used,
Blaming her for their actions,
As if she had nothing to lose.

But she's not a thing to be taken,
Or an object to be used,
She's a human being with emotions,
And a soul that's been bruised.

She deserves to be respected,
And to live without fear,
To be treated as an equal,
And have her voice be heard loud and clear.

We need to change the narrative,
And shift the focus to the crime,
Stop blaming and shaming the victim,
And hold the perpetrator accountable every time.

Let's teach our children about consent,
And the value of respect,
To build a world where everyone's safe,
And no one feels the need to deflect.

We can make a difference,
By standing up for what's right,
And showing love and compassion,
To those who've lost their light.

Let's stop the blaming and shaming,
And start healing from within,
To create a world where everyone,
Can live without fear and sin.

For every girl who's been violated,
And blamed for the crime,
We stand with you in solidarity,
And vow to fight until the end of time.


She was just a child, so innocent and pure
But they took advantage, of that she was sure
It was her own family, who she trusted the most
But they abused her, and left her feeling lost

She tried to speak up, to tell someone the truth
But they blamed her, said she was being uncouth
They said she was lying, that it couldn't be true
And so she suffered, with no one to turn to

Her body felt used, like it wasn't her own
She felt dirty and ashamed, like she had grown
Into something ugly, that no one could love
She felt trapped, unable to rise above

But she was strong, despite what they had done
She refused to be a victim, to be overcome
By the pain and the sorrow, that they had caused
She chose to rise above it all, and not be paused

She sought help, from those who believed
Who listened and supported, and helped her to relieve
The burden of the trauma, that she had to bear
She found hope, and began to repair

Her shattered sense of self, and her broken heart
She learned to love herself, and to never part
From the truth of her worth, as a human being
No longer a victim, but a survivor, strong and seeing

That she deserved love, respect and dignity
And that her past did not define her, or her destiny
She rose above the shame, and the blame
And found peace, in her own name


lets strike at the root, that causes such pain
Let us be the change, and never let it happen again





Her family, who she thought would always be there,
Are now the ones who cause her despair,
Her body, once her temple, now a source of pain,
And in her heart, she bears an unending strain.

She feels lost, alone, and violated,
Wondering how her family could be so misguided,
How they could break the sacred bond of trust,
And inflict on her a lifetime of disgust.

The pain is overwhelming, her tears never-ending,
As she struggles to cope with the unspeakable offending,
Betrayed by the ones who swore to love and care,
And now she's left with scars that can never repair.

She tries to forget, to move on and forgive,
But the memories remain, haunting her as long as she lives,
The shame, the guilt, the fear that they instilled,
All because of the evil desires they fulfilled.

She's blamed and shamed, as if it's all her fault,
For the actions of those who have no remorse or thought,
And society judges her, as if she deserves the abuse,
As if she's the one who chose to be misused.

The horror of it all, the pain that's felt
By girls who suffer in silence, as if dealt
A cruel hand by fate, left with no choice
But to endure the abuse, with no voice

It starts at home, with family and kin
The very people who should protect and win
Their trust, but instead they shatter it
Leaving the girl to suffer, bit by bit

The father who should be a source of love
Betrays her, and turns into a monster to shove
His desires onto her, without any care
For the damage he inflicts, or the scars he'll leave bare

The brother who should be a friend and guide
Preys on her vulnerability, and makes her hide
In fear and shame, as if she's to blame
For his actions that are nothing but a shame

The uncle who should be an elder to respect
Uses his power to force her, and neglect
Her cries for help, leaving her to suffer alone
Feeling helpless and trapped, with nowhere to run

And what about the mother who's supposed to care
She stands by and watches, as if it's fair
That her daughter's innocence is taken away
By those who are supposed to keep her safe and sway

The pain is unbearable, the scars deep
As the girl struggles to keep
Her sanity intact, and her will to survive
Against those who seek to take away her life

She was just a girl, innocent and pure
Until her own family made her feel unsure
Of what love really meant, of what was right
As they took from her the most sacred of light

They whispered promises of protection and care
But then violated her body, leaving her in despair
With each touch, each assault, each degrading word
They chipped away at her spirit, like a cruel, sharp sword

Her body became a battleground, a site of war
As they tore away her autonomy, her right to say "no more"
She was trapped in a nightmare, a hell of their making
And no one was there to hear her heart breaking

Her screams went unheard, her tears unseen
As they continued to abuse her, so cruel and obscene
And she wondered why this was happening to her
Why she couldn't escape, why there was no cure

For the pain that they caused, for the trauma they inflicted
As they used her body, her soul, like a toy, so unrestricted
And she felt so alone, so isolated in her pain
As they left her broken, shattered, again and again

The touch of terror, the weight of fear,
A trauma that's too heavy to bear,
A darkness that engulfs the soul,
A wound that refuses to be made whole.

The body, once a temple of peace,
Now a battlefield where violence won't cease,
The mind, once a garden of dreams,
Now a barren wasteland with endless screams.

The pain of abuse, a shattering blow,
Like a wildfire, it consumes us whole,
Like a serpent's venom, it spreads and bites,
Draining us of hope, as day turns to night.

Metaphors fail to capture the pain,
Words are powerless, as the tears rain,
Similes can't express the trauma we bear,
As we try to heal, to find some repair.

Personifying the pain, it takes on a life,
A demon that cuts us like a knife,
An enemy that we fight every day,
A shadow that refuses to go away.

The imagery, vivid, in shades of gray,
A memory that never fades away,
The scars that we bear, etched in our soul,
A tale of suffering that's yet to be told.

The symbolism, the weight of a chain,
A weight that we carry, like a ball and chain,
A prison that we cannot escape,
A sentence we serve, without any respite.

The alliteration, a sound so sharp,
A scream that we stifle, deep in our heart,
The assonance, a whisper so soft,
A plea for help, that we barely cough.

The consonance, a moan so low,
A plea for mercy, that no one will know,
The repetition, a mantra we say,
A hope for survival, day after day.

The rhyme, a melody that we hum,
A song of sorrow, that we sing alone,
The rhythm, a beat that we follow,
A dance with fear, that we cannot disown.

The onomatopoeia, a sound so raw,
A cry for help, that echoes and draws,
The hyperbole, an exaggeration so strong,
A pain that's intense, that lasts so long.

The irony, a cruel twist of fate,
A punishment we didn't anticipate,
The allusion, a reference to pain,
A history of suffering, that we can't contain.

The enjambment, a break so sharp,
A fracture that leaves us in the dark,
The caesura, a pause so long,
A moment of silence, when nothing is wrong.

The euphony, a harmony so sweet,
A healing that's slow, but sure to meet,
The cacophony, a discordant sound,
A suffering that's real, that we can't confound.

The anaphora, a repetition so strong,
A message that we want to prolong,
The epiphora, a repetition so clear,
A hope that's renewed, every year.

The symploce, a repetition so bold,
A truth that's spoken, that never grows old,
The metonymy, a name we give,
A trauma that lives, that we can't outlive.

The synecdoche, a part of a whole,
A wound that's deep, that takes its toll,
The antithesis, a contrast so stark,
A pain that's felt, that leaves its mark.

The apostrophe, a plea so loud,
A call for justice, that we shout out,
The cliché, used with irony,
A statement of truth, that's hard to see.

The pain of abuse, a burden we bear,
A story that's real, that we cannot repair,
The trauma we face, an endless fight,
A hope for justice, that shines so bright.

Innocence shattered, trust broken,
The weight of shame, a heavy token.
Silenced by fear, unable to speak,
The pain and trauma, forever unique.

A teacher's hand, a predator's touch,
The innocence of childhood, ripped asunder much.
Unaware of danger, we blindly trust,
Yet monsters lurk, waiting to pounce and thrust.

The memories haunt, never to fade,
A wounded heart, forever unafraid.
To speak out, to demand justice,
To fight for healing, amidst the chaos.

The scars remain, etched on the soul,
A reminder of a time, we lost control.
Yet within the pain, there lies a power,
To overcome the darkness, in the darkest hour.

Through metaphors and similes, we paint the pain,
The personification of trauma, the imagery of shame.
The symbolism of innocence, shattered and torn,
Alliteration of anguish, the consonance of mourn.

The repetition of sorrow, the rhythm of grief,
The rhyme of trauma, a silent, yet thundering thief.
The onomatopoeia of cries, the hyperbole of fear,
The irony of justice, a victory never quite clear.

The allusion to a world, where safety is the norm,
The enjambment of hope, where healing takes form.
The caesura of resilience, the euphony of strength,
The cacophony of outrage, the anaphora of events.

The epiphora of stories, the symploce of pain,
The metonymy of healing, the synecdoche of the slain.
The antithesis of silence, the apostrophe to hope,
The cliche subverted, a warrior refusing to cope.

The darkness of trauma, never to be denied,
Yet within the pain, there is hope, we shall abide.
For the power of healing, the strength of survivors,
Shall rise above the pain, with hope as their drivers.



In this world of love and union
Where hearts beat with a sweet fusion
There's an ugly practice that prevails
One that leaves a trail of tears and wails

Grooms with their demands on dowry
Judging girls by their father's money
Is this what love and marriage is?
A transactional agreement with a financial twist?

Oh, the irony of it all
As love is supposed to stand tall
Above all materialistic gain
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane

The worth of a woman reduced to her wealth
A commodity to be bought and sold by stealth
Is this what our society has become?
A place where love and compassion are numb?

Grooms with their list of demands
On cars, gold and prime lands
And if the father can't comply
The bride-to-be is left to die

Left alone to face the taunts
Of a society that wants
Nothing more than a grand show
Of wealth, power and status quo

The bride's family left in despair
Struggling to meet the groom's unfair
Demands on their financial reserves
Leaving them with shattered nerves

Oh, the irony of it all
As love is supposed to stand tall
Above all materialistic gain
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane

Why must the worth of a woman be
Reduced to her family's property?
Why must she be bought and sold
For the sake of wealth and gold?

It's time for us to break free
From this age-old atrocity
To stand up against these demands
And take a stand for what's truly grand

Love, respect and understanding
These are the values worth demanding
In a world where the worth of a woman
Is not measured by her father's money






In this world of love and union
Where hearts beat with a sweet fusion
There's an ugly practice that prevails
One that leaves a trail of tears and wails

Grooms with their demands on dowry
Judging girls by their father's money
Is this what love and marriage is?
A transactional agreement with a financial twist?

Oh, the irony of it all
As love is supposed to stand tall
Above all materialistic gain
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane

The worth of a woman reduced to her wealth
A commodity to be bought and sold by stealth
Is this what our society has become?
A place where love and compassion are numb?

Grooms with their list of demands
On cars, gold and prime lands
And if the father can't comply
The bride-to-be is left to die

Left alone to face the taunts
Of a society that wants
Nothing more than a grand show
Of wealth, power and status quo

The bride's family left in despair
Struggling to meet the groom's unfair
Demands on their financial reserves
Leaving them with shattered nerves

Oh, the irony of it all
As love is supposed to stand tall
Above all materialistic gain
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane

Why must the worth of a woman be
Reduced to her family's property?
Why must she be bought and sold
For the sake of wealth and gold?

Dowry, a weighty word that bears a heavy cost,
A price tag on the head of every girl that's lost,
A cultural practice, centuries old,
But in its essence, simply a story of gold.

The groom and his family, they make their demands,
A list of items, as if from fairylands,
Cash and jewelry, cars and lands,
All to be given by the girl's father's hands.

Her father, a hapless victim of this system,
Toiling to meet the demands of the groom's team,
Selling his land, his life's earnings,
To please the groom and his material cravings.

The bride, a pawn in this game of greed,
Her worth tied to the money she can bring,
Her dreams, her hopes, her happiness,
All lost in this monetary stress.

The society watches, but does nothing,
As the groom's family continues to fling,
Their demands, their expectations, their greed,
All at the expense of this innocent girl's need.

The law exists, but is seldom enforced,
As dowry deaths continue to be endorsed,
The bride, a victim of this social curse,
Her life cut short, a tragedy, a hearse.

Dowry, a curse that needs to be broken,
A system that needs to be unspoken,
A tradition that needs to be forsaken,
For the sake of every girl's life that's taken.

Dowry, the weight of gold and pride,
A burden borne by a groom's side,
A custom old, entrenched in greed,
A bartering of daughters, a heinous deed.

The price is set, a life is sold,
A daughter's worth, in coins of gold,
The groom's family, demands their right,
A sum so high, it's beyond sight.

The bride's family, bows to the demand,
For societal norms, they must withstand,
They sell their land, their savings, their all,
To ensure their daughter, never falls.

But what of love, and what of joy,
In this transaction, where's the employ?
What of the girl, and her wishes too,
Is she not worth, more than gold so few?

Her dreams are crushed, her voice unheard,
Her life is bartered, her freedom blurred,
A victim of tradition, of patriarchy,
A life bound in chains, a lifelong misery.

Dowry, a curse, a societal bane,
A custom steeped in deep-rooted disdain,
Let us break these shackles, and set her free,
And let her live, her life with dignity.

Innocent children, so pure and true,
Their bodies violated, their spirits subdued.
Captivity and imprisonment, a life of shame,
Their abusers walk free, their victims to blame.

Metaphors of darkness, their souls in chains,
As they struggle to break free from the pain.
Their bodies betrayed, their trust in shattered,
Their cries ignored, their innocence battered.

Personified monsters, with evil intent,
Taking advantage of the vulnerable, with no relent.
Their twisted desires, a sickening disease,
Inflicting their trauma, with such ease.

Metaphors of fire, burning deep within,
As the victims fight back, and refuse to give in.
With courage and strength, they resist and persist,
Breaking free from their tormentors, no longer dismissed.

The imagery of struggle, a fight to survive,
Against those who seek to harm and deprive.
Their voices now heard, their stories told,
Their resilience and bravery, forever bold.

The metaphors of light, shining through the pain,
As the victims reclaim their lives again.
No longer prisoners, no longer trapped,
Their souls and spirits, forever unwrapped.

For these innocent girls, so young and small,
We must stand together, to hear their call.
To end sexual violence, to break the chains,
And give them the freedom, they so rightly claim.



Innocent girls, with hearts so pure,
Their pain hidden, but still so sure.
Tears they cry, in silence and alone,
Their hearts aching, their spirits unknown.

Their pain runs deep, like a river untamed,
Carrying with it, memories of shame.
Betrayed by those they trusted most,
Their innocence lost, a cruel cost.

Their bodies violated, their souls torn apart,
A pain so deep, it grips their heart.
Memories haunt them, day and night,
Shadows of the past, an endless fight.

The pain they carry, a burden so heavy,
Their hearts and minds, never ready.
To face the world, with heads held high,
For the pain they feel, will never die.

Society fails them, time and time again,
Blaming the victim, for the sins of men.
Their pain dismissed, their voices unheard,
A system broken, a tragedy absurd.

But still they rise, with strength and grace,
Brave warriors, taking back their space.
Their pain transformed, into power and might,
As they stand tall, in the face of the fight.
I was a 6 year old girl, so innocent and pure,
When the world turned dark, and I was no longer sure
What was right and wrong, what was love and hate,
When the touch of a trusted hand became my fate.

He came in the night, when I was alone,
Whispering words that chilled me to the bone,
Promising me secrets that no one else would know,
But I didn't want to listen, I didn't want to go.

But he was older, wiser, and so much stronger,
And I was just a child, no match for his hunger,
So I gave in, I let him have his way,
And I felt my soul die a little every day.

For years, he took from me, what should have been mine,
My body, my mind, my spirit, he left me behind,
A shell of the girl I used to be,
Lost in a world of pain and misery.

I tried to tell someone, anyone who would listen,
But they said I was lying, that it was just fiction,
That no one would do such a thing to a child,
That it was all in my head, that I was just wild.

So I kept it inside, the shame and the fear,
Hoping that one day, the end would be near,
But the memories stayed, like a cancerous growth,
Eating away at my soul, like a terrible oath.

I hated myself, for what he had done,
For the way he had made me feel, for what I had become,
I felt dirty, tainted, and forever scarred,
And I couldn't escape the darkness, no matter how hard.

But then something changed, a spark in the night,
A glimmer of hope, a flicker of light,
I realized that I was not to blame,
That I was not the one who should feel shame.

It was him, the abuser, the monster within,
Who had committed the sin, who deserved the spin,
Of the wheel of justice, that would make him pay,
For what he had done, day after day.

And so I began to heal, to fight back,
To reclaim my life, and to attack,
The demons that haunted me, the voices in my head,
Telling me that I was better off dead.

I learned to love myself, to forgive the past,
To see the beauty in life, and to make it last,
I found my voice, my power, my strength,
And I used it to break free, to go to any length.

And though the journey was long, and sometimes hard,
And the memories still lingered, like a playing card,
I knew that I was not alone, that others had survived,
And that I could make it, if I just tried.

So here I am, standing tall, and strong,
A survivor of the abuse, a fighter for the wronged,
And though the scars still remain, and the pain still stings,
I am free, and that is all that really means.

She is a survivor, a warrior of sorts,
With scars that run deep and emotions that distort.
She has seen the worst of humanity's face,
And survived the horror of childhood's disgrace.

The memories linger, haunting her days,
A relentless nightmare that never fades.
The touch of another sends shivers down her spine,
A reminder of the violation that was once hers to confine.

The shame is a constant, a burden she bears,
A heavy weight that she cannot share.
For who could understand the pain and fear,
Of a child who was robbed of their innocence, dear?

The anger burns bright, a fire within,
Fuelled by the injustice and the world's sin.
She rails against the cruelty that she has known,
And vows to never let it define her alone.

But healing is a journey, a path that is long,
With twists and turns that leave her feeling wrong.
The triggers are many, the road is tough,
But she holds on to hope, for it is enough.

The scars may never fade, but she can choose,
To let them define her, or to let them loose.
To live a life that is rich and full,
And find the beauty in each moment, no matter how small.

She is not just a survivor, she is a thriver,
A phoenix rising from the ashes of fire.
She chooses to live, to love, to laugh,
And leave the past behind, a distant photograph.

For she is more than the pain that was dealt,
More than the secrets that were kept.
She is a person, with dreams and hopes,
And she will not be defined by her past's scope.

So let her rise, let her soar,
And leave the darkness behind, forevermore.
For she is a survivor, a warrior of sorts,
With scars that run deep, but a spirit that sports.

Innocent and pure, a child at play,
Her world shattered in one horrid day,
A monster lurking, a predator in disguise,
Stealing her light with sickening lies.

She trusted him, the one who stole her trust,
A vile creature of malice and lust,
He ripped away her childhood, her sense of self,
Leaving her scarred, in a state of mental health.

Her body, once a temple, defiled by sin,
The marks left behind a permanent grin,
Her pain runs deep, it's etched into her soul,
Her trauma so great, it's hard to control.

The shame and guilt that follows her around,
An unwelcome guest in her mind, always found,
The world can be so cruel and unforgiving,
Leaving her feeling helpless, barely living.

The memories linger, the flashbacks burn,
The terror and horror of that fateful turn,
The monster's voice echoes, it won't go away,
A haunting reminder, day after day.

The scars may fade, but they'll never disappear,
The pain may lessen, but it's always near,
A wound that's been opened, never to heal,
A heart left broken, unable to feel.

But hope remains, a light in the dark,
A voice that whispers, you're more than a mark,
You're a survivor, a warrior, a force to be reckoned,
A strength that's grown, from what once was beckoned.

The journey is long, the road is tough,
But she's not alone, she's got her rebuff,
A support system that's there to stay,
Helping her through, come what may.

The monster's voice grows fainter each day,
As she learns to find her own way,
Through therapy, love, and faith in herself,
She finds the courage to seek out her own wealth.

She learns to love herself, with all her scars,
To see herself as a warrior, reaching for the stars,
She finds her power, her voice, her might,
And she stands tall, ready to fight.

She fights for justice, for all to see,
That victims of abuse can break free,
She fights for those who've yet to speak,
To show them that they're not weak.

She rises from the ashes of her past,
A phoenix reborn, with strength that will last,
She's found her freedom, her power, her great,
And now she knows, she always had a choice.

The scars may remain, but they're not her fate,
She's found her strength, her courage, her mate,
And as she walks through life, with her head held high,
She knows she's a warrior, and she'll never die.

Shadows linger, whispers hiss,
The memories of that day persist,
The darkness creeps, it won't let go,
A child left broken, with wounds that show.

The innocence lost, the trust destroyed,
The world turned black, devoid of joy,
The monster came, with his wicked ways,
Leaving behind a life in disarray.

Shame becomes her constant friend,
A weight she carries, until the end,
The world can be so cruel and cold,
Leaving her feeling numb and old.

The shadows of shame, they follow her,
Taunting, jeering, a constant blur,
The fear and anger, they boil inside,
A battle she fights, with nowhere to hide.

The nights are long, the dreams are cruel,
The terror grips her, a vicious duel,
The pain is real, it won't subside,
A wound that's opened, never to hide.
