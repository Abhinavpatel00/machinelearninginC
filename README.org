this is basic machine learning model that i trained with my own book 

it is implemented in C with no dependencies 
I am using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain][Markov Chain]] implemented within a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table][hash map]] as the machine
learning structure. 

** Build



``js
  gcc main.c
``js

This will produce ~a.exe~, 

then you can run 

``js
./a.exe her_dead_voice.txt
``js

 to let the magic happen
