this is basic machine learning model that i trained with my own book 

it is implemented in C with no dependencies 
I am using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain][Markov Chain]] implemented within a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table][hash map]] as the machine
learning structure. 


## Features

- **No Dependencies Required**: Say goodbye to the hassle of installing numerous libraries. This model is self-sufficient and easy to set up.

## Getting Started

To embark on this intriguing journey, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Build

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Build the project using the following command:

   ```shell
   gcc main.c
   ```

   This will produce an executable file, typically named `a.exe` on Windows or `a.out` on Unix-based systems.

### Run

With the project successfully built, it's time to witness the magic. Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

```shell
./a.exe her_dead_voice.txt
```

Replace `her_dead_voice.txt` with the path to your own text file if desired. Now, sit back and watch as the machine learning model performs its wonders.
